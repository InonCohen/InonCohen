# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I am a recent Software Engineering graduate with a strong foundation in software development. Proficient in C, C++, and Python, I am passionate about learning new programming languages and their intricacies. Recently, I explored Solidity and applied it in a project, which I found thoroughly enjoyable and enlightening. The experience provided me with valuable insights into its dedicated IDEs, as well as its advantages and limitations.

After working part-time as a C++ programmer for two and a half years, I am now eager to take the next step in my career and secure my first full-time position as a developer. I am enthusiastic about contributing to impactful projects and continuing to grow as a developer.
